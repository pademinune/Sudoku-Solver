Run "sudoku.py" and then input each row one line at a time. If the position is empty, put a 0, otherwise put the numbers 1 to 9. After putting in 9 rows, it will begin searching for a solution, and then output the solution as a grid seperated by rows and spaces.

Sample input (after every row, you need to press enter):

0 7 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 7 0 6 1
8 0 0 0 3 5 1 0 0
9 3 6 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 7 4 0 9 0 0 0
0 6 2 5 1 0 0 8 4
3 0 1 0 9 4 0 0 7
0 5 0 8 7 0 6 1 0


Note that for the very hard puzzles, it could take up to 2 minutes.
