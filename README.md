Run "main.py" and then input each row one line at a time. If the position is empty, put a 0, otherwise put the numbers 1 to 9. After putting in 9 rows, it will begin searching for a solution, and then output the solution as a grid seperated by rows and spaces. Note that for the very hard puzzles, it could take up to 2 minutes.
